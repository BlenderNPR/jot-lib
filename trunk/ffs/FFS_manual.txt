1. Sweep

1.1 Activation: Slash on a line or Delayed slash on a panel 

After activation, a dotted guideline will appear. Mode becomes
"revolve". Probably there're some red dots denoting folding
points if a delayed slash starts at a panel.

1.1.1 Slash on a line

A slash can be a delayed slash. The slash should be straight
enough. The line cannot be connected to other curves. And the
slash should start near the center of the straight line curve and
be perpendicular to the line.

1.1.2 Delayed slash on a panel

The boundary of the panel should be a single piece. And the panel
should be planar enough.

1.2 Operations: Tap, Line, Slash, Stroke

1.2.1 Tap

Tap near end of guideline, the system will do uniform sweep based
on guideline length.

Tap elsewhere on the guideline, it will do uniform sweep based on
tap location.

1.2.2 Line

If it is a trim stroke, it has to be short and run across the
guideline. Then it is handled the same as a slash as described in
the next section.

If it starts at sweep origin and ends near the guideline, the
system will do uniform sweep.

If it starts near guideline end and is nearly parallel to the
guideline, the system extends the guideline.

Else, it is treated the same as a stroke, as described below.

1.2.3 Slash

The slash should intersect the guideline and be short. A slash
gesture across the guideline trims its tip.

1.2.4 Stroke

If the mode is activated by delayed slash on a panel, stroke
shouldn't be closed or self-intersecting and cannot cross the
guideline. It must start at a red dot.  If the stroke starts at a
red dot and end near the guideline, then we're building a
cone. If the panel is constructed by a single closed curve, then
we're building a surface of revolution. Else, we're building a
box.

If the mode is activated by slash on a line, stroke currently
does nothing.

1.3 Deactivation: Tap anywhere not near the guideline or Finish
  of successful operations

After deactivation, guideline disappears. Mode returns to
previous mode.
