sbm paper:
  create paper from latex templates
  write outline, plan demos

cover:
  tube, with oversketch
  revolve
  smooth join
  3D curve oversketch
    planar
    shadow
    stereo
    curves, points
  crease widget
  direct-draw mode?
    3D cursor for drawing e.g. swingset
  better rendering?

demos:
  rocket ship
  octopus
  simple swingset

later submission:
  punch out, inflate, cut out
  paper doll
  procedural generation

-----------------------------------------------------------------

bug/fixes:
  skin smoothing
  fix crease editing (wanghx)
  inflate widget:
    too hard to activate and define offset
  inflate bsurface:
    use of skin is problematic; should be more robust

doc
   user guide (wanghx)
     add gesture details
     widgets

UI
  cursor 3d (sapo)
  floor widget for transforming objects (sapo)
  fix draw manip (sapo)
  better selection UI
    edges
    faces

curves/points
  fix shadow interaction
    points
    curves
  implement stereo for points/curves
    or fix current implementation
  be able to lengthen a curve by oversketch
  fix curve oversketch to be smoother (sapo)
  fix use of coord systems in drawing curves
    better choice of plane
    use cursor 3D

inflation:
   disable auto crease generation (wanghx)
   
primitive:
   provide support for gradual change along the skeleton 
     when building tube (wanghx)
   
panel:
  more tessellation (sapo)
  interactive re-triangulation

sweep
  support modification after create (wanghx)
  revolve: better handling of resolution at profile  

roof:
  inflation

paper doll:
  oversketch doll using cursor 3d
  oversketch skeleton using control level (wanghx)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
done
-----------------------------------------------------------------
paper doll:
  define skeleton from panel
  oversketch skeleton
  fix panel creation so it is robust
  class for paper doll (like Primitive)
    (related to inflate)
  toggle between display modes: ribbon vs. doll

manip:
  drag curve: move both endpoints
  move just the selected component
  
roof:
  corner detection
  
inflation:
   editing
   
primitive:
   generalize base areas for building tubes
