jot-lib is a collection of C++ libraries developed at Brown University, Princeton University, and the University of Michigan from the mid-1990's to 2007, and used in support of research in 3D graphics. Various projects were published as papers, including "Dynamic 2D Patterns for Shading 3D Scenes" (SIGGRAPH 2007), "Line drawings via abstracted shading" (SIGGRAPH 2007), "Free-form Sketch" (SBIM 2007), "Coherent Stylized Silhouettes" (SIGGRAPH 2003), and "WYSIWYG NPR" (SIGGRAPH 2002).

As of late 2007 there are no active jot developers. We are releasing the source code is the hope that parts of it will be useful to 3D graphics developers. Recent focus in jot has been on GLSL shaders (which are easy to port to other systems) and sketch-based 3D modeling.

This project was supported in part by the NSF (CCF-0447883).
