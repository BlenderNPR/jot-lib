This document has been created to get down some of the things you notice that you can do with FFS. Whether intentional or no, this is a good start identifying all that one can do with the program.

Steps:
Create a surface. 
Inflate the surface and double-click on one of its quads in the ribbon.
Cross out the quad by drawing two strokes to opposite corners.

Result: FFS created a new modeling plane for creating new lines and surfaces.
