<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
Jot provides a reference counting (RC) mechanism that attempts to automate
the memory management process. The goal of Jot's RC mechanism is to make
memory de-allocation completely transparent to the application programmer.
However, for a variety of C++ reasons, this goal is difficult to completely
achieve. Thus Jot's RC mechanism is nearly transparent, but there are still
a couple of situations where the application programmer must be aware of
RC details.
<P>Jot's RC mechanism consists of three types of objects:
<OL>
<LI>
a reference count REFcounter;</LI>

<LI>
a templated smart pointer REFptr; and</LI>

<LI>
a destruction lock, REFlock.</LI>
</OL>
The reference count is an abstraction that contains an integer and methods
for incrementing and decrementing that integer, and automatically freeing
itself when its reference count transitions to zero. The smart pointer
is a container that allows transparent access to the cotained object while
at the same time automatically managing to decrement and increment the
reference count whenever the object is de/referenced. The destruction lock
is used only to overcome a shortcoming with C++'s definition of constructors.
<H2><A NAME="baseclass">Reference Count Base Class</A></H2>
Objects in Jot that want to use the RC mechanism must be sub-classes of
the REFcounter class. The REFcounter class is a very simple base class for manipulating
a reference count integer. In addition, the REFcounter class implements the
protocol that whenever the reference count transitions to zero, the REFcounter
instance calls its own destructor in order to automatically de-allocate
itself.
<H2>
<A NAME="templ_smart_ptrs">Templated Smart Pointers</A></H2>
The templated REFptr base class provides a mechanism for containing and
transparently accessing a reference counted object while at the same time
automatically incrementing and decrementing the object's reference count.
<P>REFptr's are templated because they must appear to be as similar as
possible to a normal pointer variable. Thus for example, the return type
of the de-reference "-&gt;" operator for a REFptr must be of the template
type.
<P>REFptr's overload all assignment, construction and destruction operators
in order to automatically adjust the referenced object's reference count.
REFptrs are generally allocated as stack or class member variables to avoid
the issue of reference counting smart pointers themselves! Since there
is slight inefficiency when passing REFptrs by value (parameter passing,
for example, implicitly creates a new copy of the REFptr which in turn
increments the reference count), REFptrs are frequently received as either
'const REFptr &amp;'s or 'REFptr &amp;'s.
<P>If all accesses to a reference counted object are made through REFptr's,
then as REFptr's for a particular reference counted object go out of scope
the object's reference count is automatically decremented. When the last
REFptr goes out of scope, the reference count will transition to zero,
and the reference counted object will automatically be destructed.
<H2>
<A NAME="Constructors">Constructors</A></H2>
Although the majority of reference counting operations occur implicitly
though assignment and parameter construction operations, there is one situation
where the programmer must be aware of the reference counting process. When
a REFcounter sub-class is being constructed, no REFptr's can yet exist to reference
the new object. Thus it's reference count will be zero. This is usually
not a problem because the reference counted object will only be freed when
its reference count *transitions* to zero. However, if while in the body
of the constructor, a temporary REFptr variable is made that references
the object being constructed, the reference count will increment. If that
temporary variable goes out of scope at the end of (or during) the constructor
body, and if no other REFptr references the new object, then a transition
of the reference count back to zero will occur, and the object being constructed
will be destroyed.
<P>Ideally we would just lock the reference counted object in the constructor
of the REFcounter base-class and then unlock the object after the constructor
for the last sub-class of the REFcounter had been called. However, in C++ there
is no mechanism for having a function automatically called after all of
the object's constructors.
<P>Therefore, we provide a third mechanism, a REFlock, to handle this situation.
To be safe, at the start of every constructor for any reference counted
object, a REFlock temporary variable should be created that references
the object being constructed. The REFlock variable, when constructed, sets
a 'lock' flag on the reference counted object. This lock flag prevents
the reference counted object from being destructed when its reference count
transitions to zero. Since the REFlock variable exists only during the
scope of the constructor, the REFlock's destructor unsets the 'lock' flag
so that the lock autmatically goes away at the end of the constructor body.
<H2><A NAME="Inheritance">Inheritance</a></H2>
The last issue with smart pointers is how they participate in inheritance
relationships. A normal pointer in C++ for an object of a particular type, T,
can be assigned to any lvalue of type (T *) or to any type (B *), where B is
a base class of T. However, since Jot's REFptr's are templated, a
REFptr&lt;T&gt; cannot be assigned to an lvalue for a REFptr&lt;B&gt; since
there is no inheritance relationship between REFptr&lt;B&gt; and
REFptr&lt;T&gt;. In addition, we cannot define a sub-class of REFptr&lt;B&gt;
for type T since the return types of the dereferencing operators are define
to return "B types", thereby making it impossible to access methods unique to
T without a cast operation.

<P>Our solution to this is somewhat intricate and may be unnecessary in
the next generation of C++ compilers. However, for now, we provide a macro,
MAKE_PTR_SUBC, that does allow inheritance to work properly between smart
pointers. The details of this macro are quite tricky, but the overview
is that for the previous example smart pointers can be created for B and
T. These smart pointers, Bptr and Tptr, do allow any Tptr to be assigned
to a Bptr, or used wherever a Bptr is used.
