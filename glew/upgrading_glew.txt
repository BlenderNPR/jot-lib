Upgrading GLEW in Jot

Current GLEW Version used by Jot:  1.3.4
Last Updated:  15-Jun-2006

This document contains the steps that need to be taken when upgrading the version
of GLEW that is included with Jot.  For the most part, the version of GLEW that
is in Jot is exactly the same as the version of GLEW that is available at the GLEW
website.  However, a few minor changes need to be made to make GLEW work with Jot's
build system.  So, when upgrading GLEW, follow these steps:

1.  Download the latest version of the GLEW source code from the GLEW website:
         http://glew.sourceforge.net

2.  Delete all the existing GLEW headers and source files in Jot's glew directory
(but don't delete any Jot specific code like glew_singleton.H and glew_singleton.C).

3.  Get all the GLEW headers and source files out of the source code distribution
and place them in Jot's glew directory.

4.  Rename all the headers to have a .H extension and all the source files to
have a .C extension (as per Jot coding conventions).

5.  In the GLEW headers and source files, find all the #include directives that
include GLEW headers.  For each one, exchange angle brackets (< >) for quotation
marks (" "), change the "GL" directory to the "glew" directory, and change .h
extension to .H (for example, change #include <GL/glew.h> to #include "glew/glew.H").

6.  Define the GLEW_STATIC preprocessor token at the begining of each GLEW header
with the following code:

#ifndef GLEW_STATIC
# define GLEW_STATIC
#endif // GLEW_STATIC

7.  Include glew_singleton.H at the begining of all the GLEW headers with
#include "glew/glew_singleton.H".

8.  Update the makefile in Jot's glew directory to make sure it has all the
necessary .C files referenced in it.

9.  Make sure everything still compiles and runs.

10. Update this document to include the version of GLEW you just upgraded to and
the date that the upgrade was performed.  Also, change this document as necessary
to reflect any new or revised steps that need to be taken due to changes in the
new version of GLEW.

11. Commit your changes to CVS.

12. You're done!
