 <A NAME="devinput"></A>Device input using the DEV class libraries</H2>
The DEV class libraries are used to get input from a wide range of input
devices including mice, tablets, the Magellan Space Mouse, the Ascension
Bird, and the Cyber and Super gloves. The concept behind DEV is to provide
an abstract set of logical devices that both mask the details of physical
devices and also allow for interchangeability between physical devices
with a minimum of impact on application code.
<P>By using the programming abstraction of DEV's logical devices, DEV simplifies
:
<UL>
<LI>
writing drivers for new devices</LI>

<LI>
changing between physical devices using logical devices</LI>

<LI>
combining and separating devices</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
<A NAME="newdrivers"></A>Writing drivers for new devices</H2>
DEV makes it easy to write drivers for new devices (assuming the new device
has similar degrees of freedom to some existing DEV device), because the
programmer only needs to write code that converts between raw device data
and the format required by DEV's logical devices. The rest of the device
handling code is encapsulated in DEV's logical devices. To facilitate writing
the conversion code, DEV also provides a number of utilities for reading
data from a serial port.
<P>Device driver's in DEV usually are described by a class that can read
from the physical device, and that both contain and write to logical devices.
The application typically only sees the logical devices.
<H2>
<A NAME="switching"></A>Switching between physical devices</H2>
Switching between physical devices is simplified in DEV since applications
never communicate directly with the physical device. Instead applications
are buffered from physical devices by communciating with logical devices.
<P>DEV is organized around 2 logical valuator devices : DEVice_2d, and
DEVice_6d, and one logical button device : DEVice_buttons.
<P>All of the logical devices have a relatively simple interface that allows
data to be *pushed* into the logical device (from a physical device handler).
In addition, all devices support a list of observers, DEVhandlers, that
are notified whenever data has been pushed into the logical device.
<P>A DEVhandler of a logical valuator device can access both the current
value of the device, and the old value of the device through the cur()
and old() methods on the logical device. In the case of 2D devices, cur()
and old() return 2D points, and in the case of 6D devices, they return
transformations.
<P>A DEVhandler of a logical button device can access the state of any
of the buttons in the device (a maximum of 8 buttons are allowed in any
one logical button device). The state of a given button is accessed with
the get() function on the device.
<P>Thus to switch between physical devices in an application, all that
needs to be done is to either have a different physical device write to
the logical device that the application is observing, or to have the application
observer a different logical device (being written to by a different physical
device).
<H2>
<A NAME="combine_separate"></A>Combining and separating devices</H2>
Some 2D and 6D physical devices also have buttons attached to them (i.e.,
a 3-button mouse). In other situations, users attach two or more different
physical devices together to *appear* as a single physical device (i.e.,
when buttons from a mouse are attached to a Bird that doesn't have otherwise
have buttons). In either case, the user thinks of a single physical device,
even though the application must process the input using at least two different
serial ports.
<P>Therefore, DEV always distinguishes between valuator and button devices.
For example, even a three-button mouse is represented in DEV by two devices
: a logical 2D device, and a logical button device. Alternatively, a Bird
that has no buttons can be augmented with buttons from a mouse. Then in
the application, the logical 6D valuator of the Bird and the logical three
buttons of the mouse are indistinguishable from an integrated 6D three-button
device.
<P>NOTE: Since events generated with the mouse buttons typically require
information stored in the valuator device, DEV enables any button device
to contain a reference to either a 2D or a 6D valuator device.
<H2>
<A NAME="detail"></A>DEV in detail</H2>
All logical devices in DEV are subclasses of an abstract DEVice class.
<H3>
<A NAME="DEVice"></A>DEVice</H3>

<LI>
DEVice_buttons - any button device (including buttons on a mouse!)</LI>

<LI>DEVice_2d - a 2D valuator device (just the 2D stuff, no buttons)</LI>

<LI>DEVice_2d_absrel - like DEVice_2d, but supports absolute/relative addressing</LI>
<LI>DEVice_6d - a 6D valuator device (once again, no buttons)</LI>
<LI>DEVice_cglove/DEVice_sglove - Cyberglove and Superglove, respectively</LI>
<P>Since all DEVice's are logical, they must be notified whenever the physical
device that controls them has changed. To change a logical devices data,
its event() method must be called. This method receives appropriate data
(i.e, a 2D point for a 2D device) and then maps it to logical data. This
mapping is different for each logical device and is controlled by setting
parameters such as the scale and offset for 2D devices, or a mapping transformation
for 6D devices. The event() method expects absolute coordinates as input.
If the physical device generates relative coordinates (such as for a mouse),
then the event_delta() method should be used.
<H3>
<A NAME="DEVhandler">DEVhandler</A></H3>
Each logical DEVice stores a list of device observers, DEVhandlers. These
observers are all notified whenever data is pushed into the DEVice through
the event() methods.
<P>Each DEVhandler subclass must implement handle_event() method. The handle_event()
method is called with an event description, Evd, that describes what happened
to the device.
<H3>
<A NAME="Evd"></A>Evd</H3>
When an observer is notified, it is sent an event description structure,
Evd, that contains :
<LI>
DEVice * - a pointer to the device that generated the event</LI>

<LI>
DEVact - an enumeration describing the type of event that occured</LI>

<LI>
DEVmod - a bit flag of all of the modifiers active when the event occured.</LI>
<P>The Event description specifies the device, the modifier keys and the
event type that occurred. For valuator devices, the event type is always
MOV. For button devices, the event type determines which button was pressed
or released.
<H3>
<A NAME="Modifiers"></A>Modifiers</H3>
Each event contains a set of bit flags corresponding to which modifier
keys have been pressed. Since we don't want to tie our device package to
a windowing system like X11, we have a general mechanism, DEVmod_gen, that
can be used to implement modifier keys in whatever way suits an application.
Whenever an event occurs, a static method, mods(), on DEVmod_gen is called
to get the active modifiers. This method unions together the results of
three mechanisms for specifying modifiers.
<P>The first mechanism simply is a static class variable that specifies
active modifiers. This variable can be explicitly set from anywhere within
the application by calling the static method DEVmod_gen::force_mods().
<P>The second mechanism allows any DEVbuttons object to be logically mapped,
using a DEVmod_desc, to any modifier. Thus when the DEVmod_gen static method,
mods(), is called, it samples the state of all the DEVbuttons objects that
have been mapped as modifier keys, and returns the corresponding modifiers.
<P>The last mechanism allows any DEVmod_gen subclass object to be registered
with the DEVmod_gen class. Then when the mods() method is called on the
class, it will in trun call the subclass's gen_mod() method. The subclass's
gen_mod() method is expected to return the active modifiers. For an X11
based system, gen_mod() can be implemented to query the X keyboard to determine
the state of the modifier keys.
